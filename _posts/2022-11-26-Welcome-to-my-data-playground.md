## Introduction
 So...this is my first blog post and if you read this now, I’m really glad you’re here. This is my data playground and I’m going to talk about data, business intelligence, data science, machine learning, big data and all this cool great stuff everyone talks about. I'm just another person with an opinion, but hopefully i'll bring some data. As this is my first post I’ll tell you just a little about me.
## About me
Working with data and talking for all this kind of stuff, really delights me. I try to be into as much as possible components of data analytics, from data engineering to data visualization. I really enjoy returning value to the business, enabling data mindsets, help people think of data, share best practices and in general everything that helps people optimize the way they work with data.
## Why
So I started content sharing on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antonios-angelakis-249899101/) and then really liked the idea of creating a blog. I didn't know which is the best option to start, the goal was to communicate my thoughts.
This blog aims to become a place where I can share my thoughts and opinions (hopefully it will always be opinion with data), interesting implementations and tips. 
It would be nice reaching out to me with any topics and ideas you feel is meaningful to write about. 
## How
Some good news is that it turns out that starting a blog is much easier than you think. The website is created with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) where you can transform your plain text into static websites and blogs. I used [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) which hosts it directly from the GitHub repository. Like Github Pages mentions,
> Just edit, push, and the changes are live.

It was cool and easy to modify the code, understand the logic behind Jekyll, setup [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/) for search, deploy it to Github Pages finally and go live. It also made me to practice HTML since my Masters. I suppose it's the perfect opportinity to get more familiar with SEO, tags, and front end. 
The website [repo](https://github.com/angeanto/angeanto.github.io) is public.

Follow me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antonios-angelakis-249899101/), where I already share some content. I hope you to like it and keep in touch!
