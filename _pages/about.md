Hello, I am Antonis, a Data Analytics professional, based in Athens, Greece currently Business Intelligence Lead at Skroutz. Trying to constantly evolve my technical knowledge and shape data mindsets everywhere. Currently, co-leading the [Athens Tableau User Group](https://usergroups.tableau.com/athensusergroup) organising interesting events, sharing tips and meeting great people. 

# Work Experience
Started my professional journey in the field when I joined [Cardlink](https://cardlink.gr/en/) in **Jan 19'** with the role of **Data Scientist**. The main responsibilty of the role was to build models that will lead to actions either for cost saving or revenue increase.

Next, I joined [Skroutz](https://www.skroutz.gr/) in **April 21**' with the role of **Business Intelligence Analyst** and currently as **Business Intelligence Lead**, one of the things I like the most is to help people reduce the time and individual effort they need to access and explore datasets.

# Education
I've studied Maths at Department of Mathematics - Aristotle University (Thessaloniki, Greece) and then I had my MSc on Applied Informatics - International Hellenic University (Serres, Greece). 

# Tech Stack
The **tech stack** consists of: SQl, Tableau, Python, Git, Databricks, AWS, Azure, Statistics

# Interests
I like watching and playing football with friends, running half-marathons (hopefully going for 3rd time next year), table-tennis (can play hours) and traveling.
