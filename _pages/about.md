# Work Experience
- I Started my professional journey in the field when I joined [Cardlink](https://cardlink.gr/en/)(fintech, payments provider) in **Jan 19'** with the role of **Data Scientist**.

- Having promoted to **Business Intelligence Lead** the team acted as the touch point of contact between BI and 2 operational teams. I mentored both team and external analysts and stakeholders, created training material and sessions for Tableau, Metabase and internal data. 

- Currently as **Senior Data Analyst** at [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.com/), I am contributing to establish a data culture and supporting decisions for the platform.
