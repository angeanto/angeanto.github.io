Hello, I am Antonis, a Data Analytics professional, based in Athens, Greece currently Business Intelligence Lead at Skroutz. I look to constantly evolve my technical knowledge while contributing to strategic initiatives in line with the roadmap of the organization and grow, through influence, a data enablement mindset across the organizations. I realized that Athens Tableau User Group is a community that's great to be a part of and joined the leadership team. 

# Work Experience
Always trying to enjoy every job experience. From many not data relevant jobs in the past, or the private maths tutoring to high school students during university, till the data roles now the imortant part is to be happy. It's important to grow through difficult times and learn all the lessons, that's where happiness should come from. 
## Skroutz
I joined Skroutz in April 21' with the role of Business Intelligence Analyst. Back in 2005 it had started as a price-comparison engine  and is now the #1 e-commerce platform in Greece. I am working closely with stakeholders to ensure all data and reporting needs are on track and contribute to the adoption of the BI team's initiatives and tools inside the organisation. Day to day includes data analysis and deep dives using Python, SQL and BI tools to draw insights suggesting opportunities and actions for increased revenue or cost savings. 

Currently, with a Business Intelligence Lead role, always hands-on, I additionally train junior analysts  and stakeholders to improve their data mindsets using the BI Team's tools to reduce the time and individual effort needed to access and explore datasets.
## Cardlink
Cardlink is active in the field of electronic payments and operates the largest network of POS terminals in Greece. I joined Cardlink in Jan 19' with the role of Data Scientist. The main responsibilty of the role was to build modeling tools that track operational data leading to actions either for cost saving or revenue increase. Created Machine Learning models in Python with scikit-learn and pyspark deployed in Azure Databricks. Used Tableau either to create dashboards visualizing the models' outputs or product wised data.

# Skills

Below, the description of the tools I've woked with so far either in professional roles or for experimental purposes. 

## SQl
**The Alphabet.** Using SQL in all the roles and companies so far mainly in [Azure Synapse](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/synapse-analytics/) and [Amazon Redshift](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/). 

## Tableau
**The Druid.** Using also [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/) in daily basis during the professional journey. I like the capabilities it offers, trying to master it that's why I jumped in the [Athens Tableau User Group](https://usergroups.tableau.com/athensusergroup) leadership team.  

## Python
**The Special Force.** I really enjoy coding in Python using many libraries, experimenting, trying to automate as much as possible.  

## Databricks 
**The New Era.** I really find [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/) an easy to use tool. I like it for the cluster management, notebook orchestration and machine learning capabilities it offers. Used it both with Azure and AWS Cloud.  

## Cloud
**The Neccessity.** The demand for cloud computing professionals has soared, outpacing the disruptive shift from in-house servers and computing power to the flexibility and scalability of cloud-based systems. I've worked with Azure and AWS.

### AWS
**The Leader**. Worked with AWS Cloud Essentials and developed a fundamental understanding of the AWS Cloud concepts, core AWS services, security, architecture, pricing, and support to contribute to data solutions. 

### Azure
**The Start.** Worked with Azure Cloud, developed a fundamental understanding of the core concepts and contributed to sync Azure with Databricks.  

## Statistics
**The Wiki.** 
>'Statistics is a mathematical body of science that pertains to the collection, analysis, interpretation or explanation, and presentation of data,or as a branch of mathematics.Some consider statistics to be a distinct mathematical science rather than a branch of mathematics' - Wikipedia. 

Thanks to my Bachelor I enjoy studying Probabilities, Distributions, Hypothesis Testing, ANOVA and the other statistics stuff.  

# Interests

I like watching and playing football with friends, running half-marathons (hopefully going for 3rd time next year), table-tennis (can play hours) and traveling.
