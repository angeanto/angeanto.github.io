Hello, this Antonis, a Data professional, based in Thessaloniki, Greece. I work in the data analytics industry since **January 2019**.<br>
I am a **Senior Data Analyst** at Chubb, a global insurance leader and my mission is to constantly evolve my technical knowledge, shape data mindsets everywhere and inspire people. <br>

From **Jan 21'** to **Mar 24'**I was a co-leader at the [Athens Tableau User Group](https://usergroups.tableau.com/athens-tableau-user-group/) organising interesting Tableau related events, sharing tips for the tool and meeting great people.<br>

# The Course Iâ€™ve Created: Data Analytics in Modern Corporate Business

To fulfill my mission, I designed the "Data Analytics in Modern Corporate Business" course, available [here](https://kedivim-apply.ihu.gr/en/progs/prog-350). This comprehensive program is crafted to provide participants with essential skills and hands-on experience in data analytics within a corporate setting.

Participants engage in a real-world scenario that replicates a corporate data environment. From setting up data pipelines with PostgreSQL and BigQuery to automating ETL tasks with Python and creating dashboards, this simulation ensures hands-on, practical learning.

# Work Experience
- Transitioning from providing private mathematics tutorials to high school students, I started my professional data journey in the field when I joined [Cardlink](https://cardlink.gr/en/)(fintech, payments provider) in **Jan 19'** with the role of **Data Scientist**. The main responsibilty of the role was to build models that will lead to actions either for cost saving or revenue increase.

- My next step was working at [Skroutz](https://www.skroutz.gr/)(#1 ecommerce Marketplace in Greece) in **April 21'**' with the role of **Business Intelligence Analyst** in which I performed data analytics and operation reporting tasks and delivered actionable insights to business units which impacted user acquisition strategy and policies.
- As a **Business Intelligence Lead** I led a team that acted as the touch point of contact between BI and other operational teams. I mentored both team and external analysts and stakeholders, created training material and sessions for Tableau, Metabase and internal data. 

- From **May 23'** to **Nov 24'** I worked as **Senior Data Analyst II** at [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.com/), contributing to establish a data culture in the organization and supporting decisions for the platform.

# Education
I've studied Maths at [Department of Mathematics - Aristotle University](https://math.auth.gr/en/) (Thessaloniki, Greece) and then I had my MSc on [Applied Informatics - International Hellenic University](http://informatics.teicm.gr/msc_informatics/) (Serres, Greece). 

# Tech Stack
My **tech stack** consists of: SQL, Python, R, Tableau, Metabase, Git, AWS Cloud, Azure Cloud, Google Cloud Platform, Snowflake, dbt, Machine Learning, databricks, pyspark
