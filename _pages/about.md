Hello, this Antonis, a Data professional, based in Athens, Greece. I work in the data analytics industry since **January 2019**.<br>
My current role is **Principal BI Consultant** at [Seven Red Lines](https://www.srl.gr/), a data consulting firm. I have also created the [Data Analytics in Modern Corporate Business](https://kedivim-apply.ihu.gr/en/progs/prog-350) course for [International Hellenic University](https://www.ihu.gr/en/enhome) and through a modern corporate architecture I provide mentoring sessions to people who want to work in the data industry or change roles/companies.

From **Jan 21'** to **Mar 24'**I was a co-leader at the [Athens Tableau User Group](https://usergroups.tableau.com/athens-tableau-user-group/) organising interesting Tableau related events, sharing tips for the tool and meeting great people.<br>

# International Hellenic University: Data Analytics in Modern Corporate Business
To fulfill my mission, I designed the [Data Analytics in Modern Corporate Business](https://kedivim-apply.ihu.gr/en/progs/prog-350) course for [International Hellenic University](https://www.ihu.gr/en/enhome). This comprehensive program is crafted to provide participants with essential skills and hands-on experience in data analytics within a corporate setting.
Participants engage in a real-world scenario that replicates a corporate data environment. From setting up data pipelines with PostgreSQL and BigQuery to automating ETL tasks with Python and creating dashboards, this simulation ensures hands-on, practical learning.
