Hello, this Antonis, a Data professional, based in Thessaloniki, Greece. I work in the data analytics industry since **January 2019**.<br>
I am a **Senior Data Analyst** at Chubb, a global insurance leader and my mission is to constantly evolve my technical knowledge, shape data mindsets everywhere get inspired and inspire. <br>

From **Jan 21'** to **Mar 24'**I was a co-leader at the [Athens Tableau User Group](https://usergroups.tableau.com/athens-tableau-user-group/) organising interesting Tableau related events, sharing tips for the tool and meeting great people.<br>

# International Hellenic University: Data Analytics in Modern Corporate Business
To fulfill my mission, I designed the [Data Analytics in Modern Corporate Business](https://kedivim-apply.ihu.gr/en/progs/prog-350) course for [International Hellenic University](https://www.ihu.gr/en/enhome). This comprehensive program is crafted to provide participants with essential skills and hands-on experience in data analytics within a corporate setting.
Participants engage in a real-world scenario that replicates a corporate data environment. From setting up data pipelines with PostgreSQL and BigQuery to automating ETL tasks with Python and creating dashboards, this simulation ensures hands-on, practical learning.
