## 🏆 Certification & Grading

| Component       | Weight |
|----------------|--------|
| Assignments     | 20%    |
| Capstone Project| 80%    |

🧮 Must score 75/100 or more to get certified.  
Track progress through module-wise assignments and complete a comprehensive capstone for final evaluation.

**Example Grade Calculation**
Assignment scores:
- 65/100
- 70/100
- 90/100
- 100/100
- 76/100

The total assignment score is 401 out of 500, averaging 80.2 out of 100. For final grade calculation:
80.2 (assignment average) * 0.2 (20%) = 16.04

Thus, to achieve the required final score of 75, the candidate needs at least:
75 (required final score) - 16.04 (assignment contribution) = 58.96 on the capstone project.
