        "title": "Welcome to my data playground!",
        "excerpt":"   Introduction  So‚Ä¶this is my first blog post and if you read this now, I‚Äôm really glad you‚Äôre here. This is my data playground and I‚Äôm going to talk about data, business intelligence, data science, machine learning, big data and all this cool great stuff everyone talks about. I‚Äôm just another person with an opinion, but hopefully i‚Äôll defend it with some data. As this is my first post I‚Äôll tell you just a little about me.   About me  Working with data and talking for all this kind of stuff, really delights me. I try to be into as much as possible components of data analytics, from data engineering to data visualization. I really enjoy returning value to the business, enabling data mindsets, help people think of data, share best practices and in general everything that helps people optimize the way they work with data. We are also organising Athens Tableau User Group meetups with the rest of the team, inviting enthousiastic speakers, having the opportunity to connect with other data rockstars like you either  in person or online.           1st in person Athens Tableau User Group Meetup  Why  So I started content sharing on LinkedIn and then really liked the idea of creating a blog. I didn‚Äôt know which is the best option to start, the goal was to communicate my thoughts. This data playground aims to become a place where I can share my thoughts and opinions, interesting implementations and tips. The idea is to cover topics related with the Business Intelligence stack from a tech perspective and talk about:     BI Tools   SQL   Python/R   Cloud   plus anything that matters when it comes to interact with data such as:     Effective communication   Storytelling   Business understanding   It would be nice reaching out to me with any topics and ideas you feel is meaningful to write about.  How  Some good news is that it turns out that starting a blog is much easier than you think. The website is created with Jekyll using minimal mistakes theme where you can transform your plain text into static websites and blogs. I used Github Pages which hosts it directly from the GitHub repository. Like Github Pages mentions     Just edit, push, and the changes are live.    It was cool and easy to modify the code, understand the logic behind Jekyll, setup Algolia, setup Netlify for search, setup Google Analytics, deploy it to Github Pages and finally go live. It also made me to practice HTML and CSS since my Masters. I suppose it‚Äôs the perfect opportinity to get more familiar with SEO, tags, and front end in general.  The website repo is public.   Follow me on LinkedIn, where I already share some content. Some of it will be archived here soon. Hope to like it and keep in touch!   Antonis  ","categories": [],

        "title": "Run python scripts and use output tables with Tableau Table Extension",
        "excerpt":"Why   Suppose working in a Tableau workbook and need to make some operations that either are impossible with Tableau or a bit hard. You realise that it would be achieved more easily, in a straightforward and readable way by using some Python code. Another case could be to make some predictions inside the workbook by running a simple scikit-learn model. You want the model to run everytime the data is refreshed. Available in Tableau 2022.3, Table Extensions allow you to create new data tables with an analytics extensions script. We can write a custom Python script using TabPy and optionally add one or more input tables. Using Table Extensions, you can unlock new data and transform, augment, score, or otherwise modify our data using Analytics Extensions like Python, R, and Einstein Discovery.   Note: Table extensions differs from writing code directly as Tableau calculated fields. It unlocks the capability to use a table in the tableau data model as output after some Python processing.   Setup &amp; Configuration  Let‚Äôs start cooking üßë‚Äçüç≥.   Python  First, download Python from here.   Tableau Desktop  Next, download Tableau Desktop(&gt;= 2022.3 version). We‚Äôll NOT use Tableau Server for this example.   Tabpy  TabPy(the Tableau Python Server) is an Analytics Extension implementation that expands Tableau‚Äôs capabilities by allowing users to execute Python scripts and use the output either in a calculated field or as table extension.  To install TabPy using pip, run:    pip install tabpy  and to start the server run:   tabpy    The desired output is something like this:        By navigating to localhost:9004 ensure that the server is running successfully.       We are now ready to taste our food ü•Ñ.   The Actual Thing  We‚Äôll use the Sample - Superstore dataset to build 5 clusters with Quantity,Discount,Profit variables.   Connection   By navigating to Settings and Performance and selecting Manage Analytics Extension Connection connect with the python server.     Data pane  We can now select any of the existing tables from our connections and notice that when a table is dragged into the pane the input table and output table selections appear in the bottom.We also can insert our script.     Note: The image used above contains code and schema from another example.   Our output table is shown as Table extension.In Script, enter your script, select Apply and choose Update. Now and the results will appear in the Output Table tab. When the code runs, the output table will include any new columns from the returned python dictonary. The new column cluster has been created.     Code  The script contains the code below.   import libraries import pandas as pd  import numpy as np from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler from sklearn.cluster import KMeans #Convert tableau imported table to pandas df arg1 = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(_arg1) #Fit K-Means kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=5,  random_state=0).fit(     arg1[['Quantity','Discount','Profit']]) #Get cluster assignment labels labels = kmeans.labels_ #Format results as a DataFrame results = pd.DataFrame([labels]).T #Rename column results.rename(columns={0: 'cluster', }, inplace=True) #Join to main dataframe orders_clusters = pd.concat(     [arg1, results], axis=1) #Return table as dictionary return orders_clusters.to_dict(orient='list')   Clusters  We can now visualize our clusters. In the Distribution worksheet, we can say hello.   The Discount Profit scatterplot displays the correlation between 2 out of the 3 independent variables highlighting the colour of each cluster.     Summary  In a nutshell‚Ä¶We‚Äôve managed to run python in Tableau Desktop locally and started a TabPy server. We can store data as dataframes from any database. Depending on our desired outcome, we may use tables from existing connections (or not), manipulate this data based on our needs and finally blend with the tables placed in our Tableau Data model. The python script should return a dictionary which will be used as the extended table.

        "title": "Increasing the reputation of Business Intelligence teams within an organization",
        "excerpt":"Business intelligence (BI) teams play a crucial role in helping organizations make informed decisions and achieve their goals. However, establishing and maintaining a strong BI team can be challenging. Here are a few basic tips for establishing and increasing the reputation of BI teams within an organization:   Clearly define the team‚Äôs mandate and responsibilities  It is important that the BI team‚Äôs mandate and responsibilities are clearly defined and understood by all stakeholders. This will help the team focus on its core objectives and deliver value to the organization. It can play significant role to communicate efficiently the mission of the team within the organization.           Example: The BI team‚Äôs mandate might be to act as a data hub and support initiatives regardless of teams invloved. Alternatively, it can support specific team(s) because of complex data or lack of analysis skills.   Build strong relationships with other teams  BI teams often work with a variety of teams within an organization, such as sales, marketing, and operations. Building strong relationships with these teams can help the BI team understand their needs and priorities, and ensure that their work is aligned with the organization‚Äôs goals.           Clearly communicate the value of the business intelligence team‚Äôs work: Make sure other teams understand how the insights and data provided by the team can help them achieve their goals and make better decisions.            Foster collaboration: Encourage members of the team to work closely with other teams on projects and initiatives. This will help build trust and understanding between the teams.            Be responsive to other teams‚Äô needs: Show that the team is responsive to the needs of other teams by quickly addressing their requests for data and insights.            Share knowledge: Share the knowledge and skills of the team with other teams. This will help other teams become more self-sufficient in using data and insights to support their work.            Be transparent: Share the team‚Äôs process and methodologies to gather, analyze, and present data. This will help other teams understand the context and limitations of the data they are working with.            Encourage feedback: Encourage other teams to give feedback on the work of the BI team. This will help to improve and better serve the needs of the organization.            Hold regular meetings: Hold regular meetings between your team and other teams to discuss upcoming projects, share progress and results, and address any concerns or issues.            Show results and celebrate: Share the results and impact of the business intelligence team‚Äôs work with the rest of the organization. This will help other teams see the value of the work that the BI team does and how we work together to achieve shared goals.       Foster a culture of continuous learning  BI teams should be committed to staying up-to-date with the latest technologies and best practices. Encouraging team members to attend conferences, workshops, and training sessions can help the team stay at the forefront of the field.           Encourage cross-training: Encourage members to learn about the work of other teams, and vice versa. This will help build understanding and appreciation for the work of different teams and the skills they bring to the table.            Create opportunities for learning: Set up regular training sessions, workshops or seminars where BI staff can share their expertise with other teams, or where other teams can share their knowledge with them.            Create a mentorship program: Set up a mentorship program where the BI team can mentor less experienced members of other teams, and vice versa. This will help build trust and understanding between team members.            Encourage experimentation: Encourage the team to experiment with new technologies, techniques, and methods. This will help everyone learn and grow.            Share best practices: Share best practices and lessons learned either between team members or other teams. This will help everyone learn from the successes and failures of others.            Create a learning culture: Create a culture of continuous learning by encouraging everyone to take initiative and take ownership of their own learning.            Make use of modern learning technologies: Encourage the use of online resources and digital learning platforms to access training, tutorials and other educational materials.            Celebrate success: Recognize and celebrate the successes of both BI and other teams and how they have grown and developed through learning. Retro sessions are a great way to measure the progress.            Use data to drive learning: Encourage the use of data and analytics to measure the effectiveness of learning and training programs, and use this information to guide future learning initiatives.            Lead by example: Lead by example and demonstrate the importance of continuous learning and professional development in your own work.       Deliver value  The most effective way to increase the reputation of a BI team is to consistently deliver value to the organization. This means providing insights and recommendations that drive meaningful business outcomes.           Lead by example: Lead by example and demonstrate the importance of data-driven decision making and collaboration in your own work.            Understand the business: Take the time to understand the business goals, objectives, and strategies of the organization. This will help you to provide insights and data that are directly relevant to the business.            Provide actionable insights: Provide insights and data that are actionable, meaning they can be used to make decisions and take actions that will drive the business forward.            Be timely: Provide insights and data in a timely manner, so that they can be used to support decision-making and inform the direction of the business.            Communicate effectively: Communicate the insights and data provided by the BI team in a clear and concise manner, so that they can be easily understood and acted upon by decision-makers.            Use the right tools: Use the right tools and technologies to collect, analyze, and present data. This will help to deliver insights and data in an efficient and effective manner.            Be flexible: Be flexible and responsive to changing business needs and priorities. In this way, you can deliver value to the business in a timely and effective manner.            Measure and report on the results: Measure and report on the results of the BI team‚Äôs work in terms of how it has helped the business to achieve its goals and objectives.            Collaborate with other teams: Collaborate with other teams within the organization to understand their data needs and how the business intelligence team can support them to achieve their objectives.            Continuously improve: Continuously improve the business intelligence team‚Äôs processes and methods to ensure they are delivering the most value to the business.       Example: A manufacturing company is experiencing high costs and inefficiencies in their production process. The team can collaborate with stakeholders and recommend:   ‚Ä¢ Specific types of equipment or automation that have been proven to reduce downtime, increase production output, and improve efficiency.  ‚Ä¢ Implement new scheduling system to reduce inventory and increase efficiency or a new capacity planning system to optimize production schedules.  ‚Ä¢ Implement a data-driven approach: The team could recommend implementing a data-driven approach to production, where decision-making is based on data analysis, rather than just experience.  ‚Ä¢ Identify key performance indicators such as machine downtime, labor costs, and production output, and track progress against these metrics over time to measure the effectiveness of the implemented changes.

        "title": "Fundamentals of SQL Query Optimization",
        "excerpt":"SQL query optimization is critical for advanced users who work with large, complex databases. Even small improvements in query performance can translate to significant gains in productivity and cost savings.   In some cases, poorly optimized queries can even bring a system to its knees.  At its core, query optimization involves finding the most efficient way to retrieve data from a database. This often requires a deep understanding of the database structure, as well as the underlying hardware and software environment. Optimizing queries involves a variety of techniques.In this post, we will explore some of these advanced techniques in greater detail, providing examples and best practices for optimizing SQL queries.   Below you can find some ways to significantly improve the performance and readability of your SQL Queries.    Use lowercase code  The truth is that for many years, I used to code in uppercase SQL. This finally changed, when I had to adapt myself in a professional setting that codes lowercase. I got used to it immediately and I never looked back.    Despite the fact that uppercase is more commonly used for SQL keywords, as it can make the code easier to read and differentiate between keywords and identifiers, unfortunately, it is not ergonomic. Lowercase style is less ‚Äúnoisy‚Äù and more natural. You do not have to focus on pressing CAPS LOCK but in the SQL side of things. Finally, readability is getting the same when you are getting used to lowercase.    Instead of this  SELECT     department      , COUNT(*) AS total_employees  FROM Employees  WHERE department IN ('Sales', 'Marketing') GROUP BY department HAVING COUNT(*) &gt; 10  ORDER BY total_employees DESC  Do this  select      department     , count(*) as total_employees   from employees  where department in ('Sales', 'Marketing')  group by department  having count(*) &gt; 10  order by total_employees desc  Consistency is key when it comes to choosing between uppercase and lowercase keywords. If you‚Äôre working on a team or with a codebase that uses lowercase keywords, it‚Äôs important to maintain that style for the sake of consistency and clarity.  Ultimately, the choice between uppercase and lowercase SQL keywords comes down to personal preference and the style guidelines of your team or organization.   Use leading commas  In SQL, leading commas and trailing commas refer to the placement of commas in a list of items within a SQL statement. Let‚Äôs break down these terms:     Leading commas refer to commas that appear at the beginning of each element in a list   Trailing commas refer to commas that appear at the end of each element in a list   Of course, there is no single standard for how to write SQL code. Some people use uppercase keywords, while some lowercase. Some use trailing commas and others leading commas.    Trailing commas style is easier to read for most people. One advantage of using leading commas is that the last item doesn‚Äôt differ from the others, but on the other hand the first item differs.    To my experience, leading commas style is easier for debugging as for errors that will occur due to missing commas, it will be faster to check the lines from start instead of their end and fix the appropriate line.    The most crucial thing here is to adapt ourselves in the organisation that we belong and stick to the team‚Äôs coding style. It‚Äôs more useful to have pieces of code with a consistent look, rather applying your personal preferences.   Instead of this  select      order_id,      order_date,      user_id,      customer_name,      line_item_id  from line_items  Do this  select      order_id     , order_date     , user_id     , customer_name     , line_item_id from line_items  aha moment: Imagine that a comma is missing. Which style suits you bette for debugging?   Refer table names in columns  In a database with multiple tables, it is possible that two or more tables have columns with the same name. If we don‚Äôt specify the table name when selecting columns, the database may not know which column we are referring to, leading to errors or incorrect results.    Instead of this  select     order_number     , order_date      , first_name     , last_name     , product_name     , price from orders o inner join customers c on o.customer_id = c.id inner join products p on o.product_id = p.id where c.last_name = 'Smith' and p.price &gt; 100 order by order_date desc;  Do this  select o.order_number         , o.order_date        , c.first_name        , c.last_name        , p.product_name        , p.price from orders o inner join customers c on o.customer_id = c.id inner join products p on o.product_id = p.id where c.last_name = 'Smith' and p.price &gt; 100 order by o.order_date desc;  It makes the query more readable and easier to understand. When we refer to columns without specifying the table name, it can be difficult to determine which table the column comes from, particularly if the query involves multiple tables.  by including the table name in the select statement we avoid conflicts when joining tables. It is possible for two or more tables to have columns with the same name.   Use Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and/or temp tables  CTEs and temp tables can make the query more readable and easier to understand. Nested queries can become very complex and difficult to read, especially if there are several levels of nesting. It can also improve query performance. When we use a nested query, the database management system has to execute the inner query before it can execute the outer query. This can result in slower query performance, especially if the inner query involves a large amount of data or a complex calculation.  They can be reused in multiple queries. When we use a nested query, we can only use the result set of the inner query once. If we need to use the same result set in multiple queries, we have to execute the inner query multiple times, which can result in slower query performance.            Breaking down complex queries into smaller, results in more manageable and readable parts. This can greatly improve the clarity and maintainability of SQL code.            Code Reusability Results can be referenced multiple times within a single query.            Easier Debugging and Testing It becomes simpler to isolate and debug specific parts of a query.            Code Documentation Properly named CTEs and temp tables can serve as self-documenting code, providing descriptive names for temporary result sets and making the intention of the query clearer.       The choice between CTEs and temporary tables depends on the specific requirements of your query and the nature of the data manipulation you‚Äôre performing. In many cases, CTEs are favored for their simplicity and scope, while temporary tables are chosen for scenarios requiring persistence and reuse of intermediate results.    Instead of this  select     c.customer_name     , qr.quarter     , coalesce(qr.quarter_revenue, 0) as quarter_revenue     , coalesce(tr.total_revenue, 0) as total_revenue from     customers c     left join (         select             customer_id             , date_trunc('quarter', order_date) as quarter             , sum(price * quantity) as quarter_revenue         from             order_items oi             join orders o on oi.order_id = o.order_id         group by             customer_id,             quarter     ) qr on c.customer_id = qr.customer_id     left join (         select             customer_id             , sum(price * quantity) as total_revenue         from             order_items oi             join orders o on oi.order_id = o.order_id         group by             customer_id     ) tr on c.customer_id = tr.customer_id;   Do this  -- Create a temp table with all orders and their dates create temporary table temp_orders as select     order_id     , customer_id     , order_date     , sum(price * quantity) as revenue from order_items group by order_id;  -- Create a temp table with the revenue for each quarter of the year create temporary table temp_quarter_revenue as select     customer_id     , date_trunc('quarter', order_date) as quarter     , sum(revenue) as quarter_revenue from temp_orders group by customer_id, quarter;  -- Create a temp table with the total revenue for each customer create temporary table temp_total_revenue as select     customer_id     , sum(revenue) as total_revenue from temp_orders group by customer_id;  -- Combine the temp tables to get the revenue for each quarter and customer select     c.customer_name     , qr.quarter     , coalesce(qr.quarter_revenue, 0) as quarter_revenue     , coalesce(tr.total_revenue, 0) as total_revenue from customers c     left join temp_quarter_revenue qr on c.customer_id = qr.customer_id     left join temp_total_revenue tr on c.customer_id = tr.customer_id;   Instead of this  select * from (   select     aggregated_data.customer_city     , aggregated_data.seller_city     , avg_price_total     , dense_rank() over (partition by customer_city order by sales desc) as rank_of_seller   from   (     select       customers.customer_city       , sellers.seller_city       , avg(price) as avg_price_total       , count(*) as sales     from order_items     left join (select seller_id, seller_city from sellers) sellers     on order_items.seller_id = sellers.seller_id     left join (select order_id, customer_id from orders where order_status = 'delivered') orders     on order_items.order_id = orders.order_id     left join (select customer_id, customer_city from customers) customers     on orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id     where price &gt; 30     group by1,2   ) aggregated_data ) rank_data cross join (select avg(price) as avg_price_total from order_items where price &gt; 30) avg_price_for_order_items where customer_city = 'cabo frio' and rank_of_seller = 3 \"\"\"  Do this  with sellers_cte as (   select     seller_id     , seller_city   from sellers )  , order_items_cte as (   select     order_id     , order_item_id     , seller_id     , price   from order_items   where price &gt; 30 )  , avg_price_for_order_items_cte as (   select     avg(price) as avg_price_total   from order_items_cte )  , orders_cte as (   select     order_id     , customer_id   from orders   where order_status = 'delivered' )  , customers_cte as (   select     customer_id     , customer_city   from customers )  , aggregated_data as (   select     customers_cte.customer_city     , sellers_cte.seller_city     , count(*) as sales     , avg(order_items_cte.price) as avg_price_per_city_combo   from order_items_cte   left join sellers_cte   on order_items_cte.seller_id = sellers_cte.seller_id   left join orders_cte   on order_items_cte.order_id = orders_cte.order_id   left join customers_cte   on orders_cte.customer_id = customers_cte.customer_id   group by 1,2 )  , rank_cte as (   select     aggregated_data.customer_city     , aggregated_data.seller_city     , avg_price_per_city_combo     , dense_rank() over (partition by customer_city order by sales desc) as rank_of_seller   from aggregated_data )  select * from rank_cte cross join avg_price_for_order_items_cte where customer_city = 'cabo frio' and rank_of_seller = 3   Note: These queries achieve the same result but they are more clear and easier to read and understand. They are also faster, especially if there are many orders and/or customers, because it is not executing subqueries for each row in the main query. It breaks the query down into smaller, more manageable parts, and simplifies the logic, making it easier to read and optimize.   Use proper naming convention  Overall, it is important to use a consistent naming convention and to choose names that are descriptive, clear, and easy to understand. This makes it easier for users to work with the database and ensures that queries and joins are accurate and efficient.    Instead of this  create table emp (     emp_id int primary key     , fn varchar(50)     , ln varchar(50)     , date_birth date     , hd date     , dpt_id int );  Do this  create table employees (     employee_id int primary key     , first_name varchar(50)     , last_name varchar(50)     , date_of_birth date     , hire_date date     , department_id int );  Notice how the table and column names are all abbreviated and use a non-standard naming convention. The table name is in singular form, which could be confusing if there are multiple entities in the table.   The column names use abbreviations, which may not be immediately clear to users who are not familiar with the system. This can make it difficult to understand the relationships between tables and can lead to confusion and errors in querying the database.   Avoid select *  Please stop doing that. Reduce the number of columns returned in the select statement to only those that are necessary for the query.   This is a good practice for several reasons, especially in a columnar database.  In a columnar database, each column is stored separately from the other columns, which means that retrieving data from a large number of columns can be slower than retrieving data from a smaller number of columns.  by selecting * we increase the amount of data that needs to be transferred across the network and processed by the application. This can result in higher memory usage and longer processing times, which can negatively impact query performance. Furthermore, we reduce the clutter in the select statement and make it easier to see what the query is doing.   Instead of this  select *  from orders  Do this  select      order_id     , user_id     , order_date from orders   Use proper indentation and white spaces  Using proper indentation and spacing can help to make SQL code more readable and easier to maintain. It‚Äôs important to follow best practices and to keep the code well-organized to prevent errors and improve efficiency.

        "title": "Fundamentals of Effective Visualization and Communication",
        "excerpt":"Introduction  In data-driven decision-making world, effective visualization and communication of insights play a vital role in driving understanding, engagement, and action. Visualizing data in a clear and compelling manner enables stakeholders to grasp complex information quickly and make informed decisions. In this blog post we explore the fundamentals of an effective visualization and communication approach, along with real-life examples that showcase its impact.    Did you know? 69% of directors have fast-tracked digital business adoption.   Tailor visualizations to the audience  Adapting visualizations to the audience‚Äôs needs and preferences is essential. Consider an ecommerce organization sharing performance metrics with different stakeholders. While executives may prefer high-level summary dashboards with kpis such as sales, orders and revenue, operations team and marketing might benefit from detailed visualizations showcasing operational speed outcomes and CRM campaings effectiveness. By tailoring visualizations to specific user groups, the information becomes more relevant, engaging, and actionable. Three basic pillars of dashboards and visualizations are:          Strategic Dashboards: Provide a high-level overview of key performance indicators (KPIs) aligned with the organization‚Äôs strategic goals. They help executives and senior management track progress, identify trends, and make informed strategic decisions. Strategic dashboards often include summary charts, trend indicators, and visualizations that focus on long-term performance.            Operational Dashboards: Designed to monitor real-time or near-real-time operational data. They provide insights into ongoing processes, performance metrics, and operational efficiency. Operational dashboards are commonly used by managers and operational teams to identify bottlenecks, address issues promptly, and optimize day-to-day operations. These dashboards may include metrics such as sales performance, production rates, or customer service response times etc.            Analytical Dashboards: Used to explore and analyze data in detail. They offer interactive capabilities, allowing users to drill down, filter, and manipulate data to uncover insights. Analytical dashboards are commonly used not only by relevant business stakeholders but additonaly by data professionals to conduct in-depth analysis, identify patterns, and generate hypotheses. These dashboards often include various charts, tables, and filters to support data exploration.          Why? With this report, sales executives can track quarter to date (QTD) sales performance, review numbers in relation to the current quota and previous quarters, filtered by product and opportunity type in this dashboard based on CRM data      Why? Above dashboard analyzes inventory, logistical, and finance data from across the country. Bringing the data into an analytical dashboard allows stakeholders to make sense of big data and empowers analysts to create supply chain and forecasting reports in record time.   Choose the right visualization type  Selecting the appropriate visualization approach is crucial to convey insights effectively. For instance, a retail company analyzing sales performance across different states might use a geographic heat map instead of a simple barchart to highlight sales hotspots and identify areas for expansion. By visually representing sales data on a map, decision-makers can easily identify patterns and make targeted business decisions. In the example below it‚Äôs clear that the company makes the majority of sales in the south. Such kind of information is hidden in our case if we choose a barchart.      Tip This barchart highlights the top states by sales. Don‚Äôt focus on the visualization‚Äôs format (labels etc) but only in its type. The main idea here is that sometimes there are corellations behind data.      Tip In contrast with previous viz, we can now notice that sales are concentrated in the southeast regions. Perhaps this is something that the business may is aware of but imagine a scenario that you found something interesting.Blend your technical skills with analytical thinking and business knowledge.   Choose the right visualization tools  Selecting the right visualization tools can greatly enhance the effectiveness of data communication. From widely used tools like Tableau and Power BI to programming languages like Python with libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn, the choice depends on factors like data complexity, interactivity requirements, and the target audience‚Äôs familiarity with the tools. Understand the Data: Begin by thoroughly understanding the nature of your data. Consider its complexity, size, structure, and the relationships you want to highlight. Determine whether the data is numerical, categorical, time-series, spatial, or a combination of these.   Define Objectives and Audience: Clarify your objectives for data visualization. Are you aiming to explore patterns, present trends, compare data, or tell a compelling story? Additionally, identify your target audience and their familiarity with visualization tools. This information will guide you in selecting user-friendly options or more advanced tools.   Assess Data Interactivity Requirements: Evaluate whether your visualization needs to be interactive. Interactive visualizations allow users to explore and manipulate data, providing a more engaging experience. Consider if you require features like filtering, drill-down, zooming, or hover-over tooltips to enhance data exploration.   Consider Data Size and Performance: If you are dealing with large datasets, assess the performance capabilities of the visualization tools. Some tools may struggle to handle extensive data, resulting in slow rendering or potential crashes. Ensure the chosen tool can efficiently handle the volume of data you‚Äôre working with.   Evaluate Tool Capabilities: Research and compare the features and capabilities of different visualization tools. Consider factors such as chart types supported, customization options, data integration capabilities (e.g., connecting to databases or APIs), ease of use, learning curve, and community support.   Explore Pre-Built Solutions: Many visualization tools offer pre-built templates or dashboards tailored for specific industries or data types. Evaluate whether these ready-to-use solutions align with your requirements. They can significantly reduce development time and provide inspiration for your own visualizations.   Consider Data Source and Compatibility: Examine the data sources you‚Äôll be working with and determine if the visualization tool can easily connect to and import data from those sources. Compatibility with popular file formats, databases, or data analysis platforms is important for a smooth workflow.   Evaluate Scalability and Deployment Options: Consider the scalability of the visualization tool. Will it support your future needs as your data grows? Additionally, assess the deployment options available. Some tools may offer cloud-based solutions, while others require on-premises installations.   Review Cost and Budget: Take into account the cost of the visualization tools and any associated licensing fees or subscriptions. Compare the pricing models and choose a tool that fits within your budget while meeting your requirements. Some tools offer free versions or open-source alternatives.   Seek User Feedback and Reviews: Look for reviews and feedback from users who have used the visualization tools you are considering. Their experiences and insights can provide valuable information about the tool‚Äôs strengths, weaknesses, and usability.   Did you know? More than 46% of businesses are already using a BI tool as a core part of their business strategy.   Simplify complexity  Simplifying complex data into intuitive visual representations enhances understanding. For example, a manufacturing company visualizing the amount of transportations per continent. We might use a sankey chart to depict the magnitude across different countries. By simplifying our complex dataset into one visualizatin senior managers can easily identify areas of concern and adjust their business strategies accordingly.      Did you know? 85% of business leaders agree that big data will significantly change the way that they do business.   Utilize interactive visualizations  Interactive visualizations allow stakeholders to explore data and derive insights based on their specific interests. A social media platform analyzing user engagement might provide interactive dashboards that enable marketers to filter and drill down into specific demographic segments, engagement metrics, or campaign performance. By enabling users to interact with the data, organizations empower stakeholders to make data-driven decisions in real-time.      Did you know? 56% of organizations that utilized analytics in 2020 reported faster and effective decision-making.   Contextualize data with annotations  Annotations provide additional context and guidance within visualizations. For instance, an e-commerce company analyzing website traffic might annotate significant events, such as marketing campaigns or website updates, on a line chart showcasing user visits.Stakeholders can correlate fluctuations in traffic with specific initiatives, enabling a deeper understanding of the impact of those events.By incorporating annotations into visualizations, you can add clarity, prevent misinterpretation, provide additional context, and guide the audience‚Äôs attention towards the most important aspects of the data. They are an effective means of enhancing understanding, promoting accurate interpretation, and facilitating meaningful communication of insights derived from the visualization.      Did you know? 70% of organizations think that data discovery and visualization are vital.   Visualize comparisons and trends  Visualizing comparisons and trends allows stakeholders to identify patterns and make data-informed decisions. For example, a manufacturing company comparing sales across different regions and product categories may use a line chart to display sales side by side. This visualization makes it easy to identify underperforming lines and take corrective actions to improve quality.      Did you know?  90% of sales and marketing teams cite BI as a crucial tool in getting their work done effectively.   Tell a story with data  Data storytelling involves presenting insights in a narrative format to captivate and engage stakeholders. Consider an environmental organization showcasing the impact of climate change. They could create a series of visualizations illustrating the rise in global temperatures, melting ice caps, and endangered species. By combining data visualizations with compelling narratives, the organization effectively communicates the urgency for action and mobilizes support. It‚Äôs easier to find an analyst  writing some high quality pandas from finding someone who can make an impact by presenting a data story in a senior management meeting. Data storytelling is an important skill that becomes increasingly valuable as data analysts progress in seniority.   Communication and Influence: As a data analyst, you often need to present complex data and insights to diverse stakeholders, including executives, managers, and non-technical team members. Data storytelling allows you to effectively communicate the meaning and implications of the data in a compelling and accessible manner. By telling a cohesive and engaging story, you can capture attention, inspire action, and influence decision-making based on data-driven insights.   Bridging the Gap between Data and Decision-makers: Senior data analysts often serve as intermediaries between technical teams and business stakeholders. Data storytelling enables you to bridge the gap between these groups by translating technical findings into meaningful narratives that resonate with decision-makers. By presenting data in a context that decision-makers understand, you can help them make informed choices and build trust in the data analysis process.   Persuasion and Buy-in: Senior data analysts are frequently involved in driving data-driven initiatives and implementing changes within an organization. Data storytelling plays a crucial role in gaining buy-in from stakeholders, including executives and teams responsible for implementing recommended actions. By crafting a persuasive narrative, supported by relevant data, you can effectively communicate the rationale behind your recommendations and secure support for your proposed strategies.   Influence Organizational Culture: As an analyst, you have the opportunity to influence the organizational culture around data-driven decision-making. Data storytelling helps create a culture where data is not only understood but also valued and utilized. By presenting compelling narratives and consistently demonstrating the power of data in driving insights and outcomes, you can inspire others to embrace data-driven approaches and make it an integral part of the decision-making process.      Did you know? When some students were asked to recall the speeches, only 5% remembered a statistic, but 63% remembered the stories. Take notice of the dashboard above (thanks to Athan Mavrantonis, link in references). It depicts hours/days of analyzing in an accelerated manner.   Conclusion  Effective visualization and communication of data insights are essential for driving understanding, engagement, and action. By choosing the right visualization approaches, tailoring visualizations to the audience, simplifying complexity, utilizing interactivity, telling data-driven stories, providing context through annotations, visualizing comparisons and trends, and leveraging appropriate tools, organizations can unlock the power of their data. By adopting these best practices, stakeholders can make more informed decisions, drive positive outcomes, and fuel business success.

Balance creativity with readability and relevance to make a compelling case for your candidacy as an analyst.    How to create your CV with Tableau  Below I‚Äôll demonstrate Step-by-step the way I‚Äôve created mine. Perhaps there‚Äôs space for improvement.   Data sources  Tableau Public accepts only extracts as data source type (live or extract).     We have to create our personal data in cloud sheets (One Drive in our example, you can also use GSheets) and load them using the appropriate connector. You can choose the names and the type of content you want to include in your CV. I‚Äôve created files for skills, experience, interests, personal data, etc., as seen below.   Experience:   Choose the names and the content you want to showcase for your experience. I‚Äôve included the links for companies and universities.     Personal Data:   Here, we list our personal information. I chose email, location, nationality, and age. I also incorporated today‚Äôs date, birthday data in order to calculate the age integer (with div formula) every time the extract is refreshed.    Skills:   To provide the functionality of filtering the skills per company with dashboard actions, create the skills file including the name of the company in a tall data format.       Create a separate data source for every Excel file. I chose to create a new Excel file and not a new sheet (in the same doc) for every table I need. Feel free to migrate all your data into a single document.    Content  The type of content you want to include is up to you and your preference. Of course, there are some basic guidelines and things to avoid. In my case, I chose to include:      Photo in the upper left corner along with a short text.   Personal details below the photo.   In the bottom left corner, we‚Äôll find clickable logos for LinkedIn, GitHub, etc. The dashboard consists of 3 vizzes:   Education &amp; Professional experience visualized with a Gantt chart. The Gantt chart includes details when hovering to showcase each role‚Äôs achievements and details.    Skills that can be filtered when the user clicks each role‚Äôs bar. The list will then filter out only the skills and technologies used in each role based on the company‚Äôs tech stack and projects.    Certifications along with clickable logos for each provider that redirects the user to the corresponding certification‚Äôs link.    Interaction  The workbook demonstrates some functionalities such as:     Redirecting to specific URLs  when clicking icons for social links, certification links, personal data, etc. with Tableau Dashboard Actions.    As mentioned, filtering the skills and technologies used in each role based on the company‚Äôs tech stack and projects.    To use and match logos with providers, skills, and in general column values, we use custom shapes. Custom shapes in Tableau are fast and easy to use and provide the user unlimited control over mark shapes. Tableau shapes and controls can be found in the marks card to the right of the visualization window. There are plenty of options built into Tableau that can be found in the shape palette, but what if you want to use custom shapes for effect, branding, etc.? There is a folder in ‚ÄúMy Documents‚Äùcalled ‚ÄúMy Tableau Repository‚Äù where you can find a shapes folder. Within this shapes folder, simply create a new folder for your shapes and name it an informative name. Save any custom shapes you would like to use in your visualization into this file. To load your shapes, hit reload in your shapes palette and then select the new shapes folder from the drop-down menu.    Summary   Putting all these together, below you can find my personal CV using Tableau.    Crafting your CV with Tableau offers a unique opportunity to showcase your BI skills creatively while adhering to essential CV and visualization guidelines. By leveraging Tableau‚Äôs dynamic features, you can artfully present your professional journey, skillset, and achievements in a visually compelling manner. Through imaginative yet structured visualizations, emphasize clarity, relevance, and a cohesive narrative.

        "title": "Understanding Data Contracts: A Comprehensive Guide",
        "excerpt":"Understanding Data Contracts: A Comprehensive Guide   Data contracts are formal agreements defining how data is exchanged between producers and consumers, ensuring consistency, reliability, and clarity in data usage. They are crucial for maintaining data integrity, enhancing collaboration, and reducing errors in modern data architectures.   What is a Data Contract?   A data contract specifies the structure, format, and rules of data exchange. It serves as a rulebook, ensuring that data remains consistent and predictable across different systems. This formal agreement includes details such as data schemas, semantics, service level agreements (SLAs), and metadata governance.   Why Are Data Contracts Important?      Consistency: Ensures uniform data structure across systems.   Data Quality: Maintains high data quality for accurate analysis.   Interoperability: Facilitates effective communication between systems.   Error Reduction: Minimizes data exchange errors, leading to smoother operations.   Key Components of a Data Contract      Schema: Defines data attributes, types, and constraints, ensuring data validity.   Semantics: Captures business rules and logical data relationships.   SLAs: Specifies data availability, freshness, and recovery metrics.   Metadata Governance: Includes data access controls, privacy regulations, and compliance guidelines.   Implementing Data Contracts      Define Data Requirements: Agreement on data structure and formats.   Automated Validation: Checks data against the contract before exchange.   Version Control: Manages changes to the data contract.   Documentation: Maintains clear records of the data contract.   Tools for Creating Data Contracts   Various tools help in authoring and validating data contracts, though many are still in early stages. Examples include:     Schemata: A framework focusing on contract modeling.   Soda.io: Used for creating and enforcing data quality contracts.   Best Practices      Collaborative Approach: Involve all stakeholders in creating data contracts.   Clear Language: Use simple and concise language to avoid misunderstandings.   Regular Updates: Periodically review and update data contracts to align with evolving business needs.   Versioning: Implement version control to manage contract changes without disrupting existing integrations.      Case 1: Developers and Data Engineers  Scenario* Application Developers: Produce transaction data in an e-commerce application.

        "title": "The High Cost of Poor Data Quality: An Invisible Drain on Business Revenue",
        "excerpt":"In today‚Äôs data-driven world, the importance of high-quality data cannot be overstated. Businesses rely on accurate and reliable data for decision-making, strategic planning, and operational efficiency. However, poor data quality remains a significant issue, and its financial impact on businesses is profound. Research indicates that poor data quality can cost businesses up to 20% of their revenue. This blog post delves into the hidden costs of poor data quality and underscores the necessity for businesses to invest in data quality management.   Understanding Data Quality  Data quality refers to the condition of a set of values of qualitative or quantitative variables. There are several dimensions to data quality, including:      Accuracy: How closely data values match the true values.   Completeness: The degree to which all required data is present.   Consistency: The uniformity of data across different datasets.   Timeliness: How up-to-date the data is.   Validity: The extent to which data conforms to defined business rules and constraints.   Uniqueness: Ensuring that each entity is recorded only once in the dataset.   When data falls short in any of these dimensions, it can lead to substantial problems for a business.   The Financial Impact of Poor Data Quality   The financial repercussions of poor data quality manifest in various ways:           Operational Inefficiencies    Inaccurate or incomplete data can lead to significant inefficiencies in business operations. Employees may spend a considerable amount of time correcting errors, reconciling discrepancies, and verifying data accuracy. This not only reduces productivity but also diverts resources from more critical tasks.            Lost Revenue Opportunities    Businesses rely on data to identify and capitalize on revenue opportunities. Poor data quality can result in missed sales opportunities, incorrect pricing strategies, and flawed market analysis. For instance, if customer data is inaccurate, marketing campaigns may target the wrong audience, leading to lower conversion rates.            Increased Costs    Poor data quality can lead to increased costs in various areas. For example, inaccurate inventory data can result in overstocking or stockouts, both of which are costly for businesses. Additionally, errors in financial data can lead to compliance issues and potential fines.            Damaged Reputation    Errors and inconsistencies in customer data can lead to poor customer experiences, which in turn can damage a company‚Äôs reputation. Negative customer experiences can result in lost customers and a tarnished brand image, both of which have long-term financial implications.            Poor Decision-Making    Reliable data is crucial for informed decision-making. Poor data quality can lead to flawed business strategies and decisions, which can have a ripple effect on all aspects of the business. Decisions based on inaccurate data can result in financial losses, missed opportunities, and strategic missteps.       The Path to High-Quality Data  To mitigate the costs associated with poor data quality, businesses must prioritize data quality management. Here are some steps to achieve high-quality data:           Implement Data Governance    Establish a data governance framework that defines policies, procedures, and responsibilities for data management. This framework should ensure accountability and provide a structured approach to data quality.            Invest in Data Quality Tools    Leverage data quality tools that offer capabilities such as data profiling, cleansing, matching, and monitoring. These tools can help identify and rectify data quality issues in real time.            Educate and Train Employees    Ensure that employees understand the importance of data quality and are trained in best practices for data entry, management, and usage. Data quality should be a shared responsibility across the organization.            Conduct Regular Data Audits    Regularly audit data to identify and address quality issues. This proactive approach can help maintain high data quality over time.            Establish Data Quality Metrics    Define and monitor key data quality metrics that align with business objectives. These metrics should provide insights into the state of data quality and guide improvement efforts.       Conclusion  The cost of poor data quality is a significant burden for businesses, impacting revenue, efficiency, and reputation. By investing in robust data quality management practices, businesses can turn data into a valuable asset that drives growth and success. Ensuring high-quality data is not just a technical necessity; it is a strategic imperative that can provide a competitive edge in the modern business landscape.   By understanding the financial impact of poor data quality and taking proactive steps to address it, businesses can safeguard their revenue and build a strong foundation for future growth.
