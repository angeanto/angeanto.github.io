        "title": "Welcome to my data playground!",
        "excerpt":"   Introduction  So‚Ä¶this is my first blog post and if you read this now, I‚Äôm really glad you‚Äôre here. This is my data playground and I‚Äôm going to talk about data, business intelligence, data science, machine learning, big data and all this cool great stuff everyone talks about. I‚Äôm just another person with an opinion, but hopefully i‚Äôll defend it with some data. As this is my first post I‚Äôll tell you just a little about me.   About me  Working with data and talking for all this kind of stuff, really delights me. I try to be into as much as possible components of data analytics, from data engineering to data visualization. I really enjoy returning value to the business, enabling data mindsets, help people think of data, share best practices and in general everything that helps people optimize the way they work with data. We are also organising Athens Tableau User Group meetups with the rest of the team, inviting enthousiastic speakers, having the opportunity to connect with other data rockstars like you either  in person or online.           1st in person Athens Tableau User Group Meetup  Why  So I started content sharing on LinkedIn and then really liked the idea of creating a blog. I didn‚Äôt know which is the best option to start, the goal was to communicate my thoughts. This data playground aims to become a place where I can share my thoughts and opinions, interesting implementations and tips. The idea is to cover topics related with the Business Intelligence stack from a tech perspective and talk about:     BI Tools   SQL   Python/R   Cloud   plus anything that matters when it comes to interact with data such as:     Effective communication   Storytelling   Business understanding   It would be nice reaching out to me with any topics and ideas you feel is meaningful to write about.  How  Some good news is that it turns out that starting a blog is much easier than you think. The website is created with Jekyll using minimal mistakes theme where you can transform your plain text into static websites and blogs. I used Github Pages which hosts it directly from the GitHub repository. Like Github Pages mentions     Just edit, push, and the changes are live.    It was cool and easy to modify the code, understand the logic behind Jekyll, setup Algolia, setup Netlify for search, setup Google Analytics, deploy it to Github Pages and finally go live. It also made me to practice HTML and CSS since my Masters. I suppose it‚Äôs the perfect opportinity to get more familiar with SEO, tags, and front end in general.  The website repo is public.   Follow me on LinkedIn, where I already share some content. Some of it will be archived here soon. Hope to like it and keep in touch!   Antonis  ","categories": [],

        "title": "Run python scripts and use output tables with Tableau Table Extension",
        "excerpt":"Why   Suppose working in a Tableau workbook and need to make some operations that either are impossible with Tableau or a bit hard. You realise that it would be achieved more easily, in a straightforward and readable way by using some Python code. Another case could be to make some predictions inside the workbook by running a simple scikit-learn model. You want the model to run everytime the data is refreshed. Available in Tableau 2022.3, Table Extensions allow you to create new data tables with an analytics extensions script. We can write a custom Python script using TabPy and optionally add one or more input tables. Using Table Extensions, you can unlock new data and transform, augment, score, or otherwise modify our data using Analytics Extensions like Python, R, and Einstein Discovery.   Note: Table extensions differs from writing code directly as Tableau calculated fields. It unlocks the capability to use a table in the tableau data model as output after some Python processing.   Setup &amp; Configuration  Let‚Äôs start cooking üßë‚Äçüç≥.   Python  First, download Python from here.   Tableau Desktop  Next, download Tableau Desktop(&gt;= 2022.3 version). We‚Äôll NOT use Tableau Server for this example.   Tabpy  TabPy(the Tableau Python Server) is an Analytics Extension implementation that expands Tableau‚Äôs capabilities by allowing users to execute Python scripts and use the output either in a calculated field or as table extension.  To install TabPy using pip, run:    pip install tabpy  and to start the server run:   tabpy    The desired output is something like this:        By navigating to localhost:9004 ensure that the server is running successfully.       We are now ready to taste our food ü•Ñ.   The Actual Thing  We‚Äôll use the Sample - Superstore dataset to build 5 clusters with Quantity,Discount,Profit variables.   Connection   By navigating to Settings and Performance and selecting Manage Analytics Extension Connection connect with the python server.     Data pane  We can now select any of the existing tables from our connections and notice that when a table is dragged into the pane the input table and output table selections appear in the bottom.We also can insert our script.     Note: The image used above contains code and schema from another example.   Our output table is shown as Table extension.In Script, enter your script, select Apply and choose Update. Now and the results will appear in the Output Table tab. When the code runs, the output table will include any new columns from the returned python dictonary. The new column cluster has been created.     Code  The script contains the code below.   import libraries import pandas as pd  import numpy as np from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler from sklearn.cluster import KMeans #Convert tableau imported table to pandas df arg1 = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(_arg1) #Fit K-Means kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=5,  random_state=0).fit(     arg1[['Quantity','Discount','Profit']]) #Get cluster assignment labels labels = kmeans.labels_ #Format results as a DataFrame results = pd.DataFrame([labels]).T #Rename column results.rename(columns={0: 'cluster', }, inplace=True) #Join to main dataframe orders_clusters = pd.concat(     [arg1, results], axis=1) #Return table as dictionary return orders_clusters.to_dict(orient='list')   Clusters  We can now visualize our clusters. In the Distribution worksheet, we can say hello.   The Discount Profit scatterplot displays the correlation between 2 out of the 3 independent variables highlighting the colour of each cluster.     Summary  In a nutshell‚Ä¶We‚Äôve managed to run python in Tableau Desktop locally and started a TabPy server. We can store data as dataframes from any database. Depending on our desired outcome, we may use tables from existing connections (or not), manipulate this data based on our needs and finally blend with the tables placed in our Tableau Data model. The python script should return a dictionary which will be used as the extended table.

        "title": "Increasing the reputation of Business Intelligence teams within an organization",
        "excerpt":"Business intelligence (BI) teams play a crucial role in helping organizations make informed decisions and achieve their goals. However, establishing and maintaining a strong BI team can be challenging. Here are a few basic tips for establishing and increasing the reputation of BI teams within an organization:   Clearly define the team‚Äôs mandate and responsibilities  It is important that the BI team‚Äôs mandate and responsibilities are clearly defined and understood by all stakeholders. This will help the team focus on its core objectives and deliver value to the organization. It can play significant role to communicate efficiently the mission of the team within the organization.           Example: The BI team‚Äôs mandate might be to act as a data hub and support initiatives regardless of teams invloved. Alternatively, it can support specific team(s) because of complex data or lack of analysis skills.   Build strong relationships with other teams  BI teams often work with a variety of teams within an organization, such as sales, marketing, and operations. Building strong relationships with these teams can help the BI team understand their needs and priorities, and ensure that their work is aligned with the organization‚Äôs goals.           Clearly communicate the value of the business intelligence team‚Äôs work: Make sure other teams understand how the insights and data provided by the team can help them achieve their goals and make better decisions.            Foster collaboration: Encourage members of the team to work closely with other teams on projects and initiatives. This will help build trust and understanding between the teams.            Be responsive to other teams‚Äô needs: Show that the team is responsive to the needs of other teams by quickly addressing their requests for data and insights.            Share knowledge: Share the knowledge and skills of the team with other teams. This will help other teams become more self-sufficient in using data and insights to support their work.            Be transparent: Share the team‚Äôs process and methodologies to gather, analyze, and present data. This will help other teams understand the context and limitations of the data they are working with.            Encourage feedback: Encourage other teams to give feedback on the work of the BI team. This will help to improve and better serve the needs of the organization.            Hold regular meetings: Hold regular meetings between your team and other teams to discuss upcoming projects, share progress and results, and address any concerns or issues.            Show results and celebrate: Share the results and impact of the business intelligence team‚Äôs work with the rest of the organization. This will help other teams see the value of the work that the BI team does and how we work together to achieve shared goals.       Foster a culture of continuous learning  BI teams should be committed to staying up-to-date with the latest technologies and best practices. Encouraging team members to attend conferences, workshops, and training sessions can help the team stay at the forefront of the field.           Encourage cross-training: Encourage members to learn about the work of other teams, and vice versa. This will help build understanding and appreciation for the work of different teams and the skills they bring to the table.            Create opportunities for learning: Set up regular training sessions, workshops or seminars where BI staff can share their expertise with other teams, or where other teams can share their knowledge with them.            Create a mentorship program: Set up a mentorship program where the BI team can mentor less experienced members of other teams, and vice versa. This will help build trust and understanding between team members.            Encourage experimentation: Encourage the team to experiment with new technologies, techniques, and methods. This will help everyone learn and grow.            Share best practices: Share best practices and lessons learned either between team members or other teams. This will help everyone learn from the successes and failures of others.            Create a learning culture: Create a culture of continuous learning by encouraging everyone to take initiative and take ownership of their own learning.            Make use of modern learning technologies: Encourage the use of online resources and digital learning platforms to access training, tutorials and other educational materials.            Celebrate success: Recognize and celebrate the successes of both BI and other teams and how they have grown and developed through learning. Retro sessions are a great way to measure the progress.            Use data to drive learning: Encourage the use of data and analytics to measure the effectiveness of learning and training programs, and use this information to guide future learning initiatives.            Lead by example: Lead by example and demonstrate the importance of continuous learning and professional development in your own work.       Deliver value  The most effective way to increase the reputation of a BI team is to consistently deliver value to the organization. This means providing insights and recommendations that drive meaningful business outcomes.           Lead by example: Lead by example and demonstrate the importance of data-driven decision making and collaboration in your own work.            Understand the business: Take the time to understand the business goals, objectives, and strategies of the organization. This will help you to provide insights and data that are directly relevant to the business.            Provide actionable insights: Provide insights and data that are actionable, meaning they can be used to make decisions and take actions that will drive the business forward.            Be timely: Provide insights and data in a timely manner, so that they can be used to support decision-making and inform the direction of the business.            Communicate effectively: Communicate the insights and data provided by the BI team in a clear and concise manner, so that they can be easily understood and acted upon by decision-makers.            Use the right tools: Use the right tools and technologies to collect, analyze, and present data. This will help to deliver insights and data in an efficient and effective manner.            Be flexible: Be flexible and responsive to changing business needs and priorities. In this way, you can deliver value to the business in a timely and effective manner.            Measure and report on the results: Measure and report on the results of the BI team‚Äôs work in terms of how it has helped the business to achieve its goals and objectives.            Collaborate with other teams: Collaborate with other teams within the organization to understand their data needs and how the business intelligence team can support them to achieve their objectives.            Continuously improve: Continuously improve the business intelligence team‚Äôs processes and methods to ensure they are delivering the most value to the business.       Example: A manufacturing company is experiencing high costs and inefficiencies in their production process. The team can collaborate with stakeholders and recommend:   ‚Ä¢ Specific types of equipment or automation that have been proven to reduce downtime, increase production output, and improve efficiency.  ‚Ä¢ Implement new scheduling system to reduce inventory and increase efficiency or a new capacity planning system to optimize production schedules.  ‚Ä¢ Implement a data-driven approach: The team could recommend implementing a data-driven approach to production, where decision-making is based on data analysis, rather than just experience.  ‚Ä¢ Identify key performance indicators such as machine downtime, labor costs, and production output, and track progress against these metrics over time to measure the effectiveness of the implemented changes.

        "title": "Fundamentals of SQL Query Optimization",
        "excerpt":"SQL query optimization is critical for advanced users who work with large, complex databases. Even small improvements in query performance can translate to significant gains in productivity and cost savings.   In some cases, poorly optimized queries can even bring a system to its knees.  At its core, query optimization involves finding the most efficient way to retrieve data from a database. This often requires a deep understanding of the database structure, as well as the underlying hardware and software environment. Optimizing queries involves a variety of techniques.In this post, we will explore some of these advanced techniques in greater detail, providing examples and best practices for optimizing SQL queries.   Below you can find some ways to significantly improve the performance and readability of your SQL Queries.    Avoid SELECT *  Please stop doing that. Reduce the number of columns returned in the SELECT statement to only those that are necessary for the query.   This is a good practice for several reasons, especially in a columnar database.  In a columnar database, each column is stored separately from the other columns, which means that retrieving data from a large number of columns can be slower than retrieving data from a smaller number of columns.  By selecting * we increase the amount of data that needs to be transferred across the network and processed by the application. This can result in higher memory usage and longer processing times, which can negatively impact query performance. Furthermore, we reduce the clutter in the SELECT statement and make it easier to see what the query is doing.   Refer table names in columns  In a database with multiple tables, it is possible that two or more tables have columns with the same name. If we don‚Äôt specify the table name when selecting columns, the database may not know which column we are referring to, leading to errors or incorrect results.   No  SELECT * FROM orders o INNER JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.id INNER JOIN products p ON o.product_id = p.id WHERE c.last_name = 'Smith' AND p.price &gt; 100 ORDER BY o.order_date DESC;  Yes  SELECT o.order_number,         o.order_date,         c.first_name,        c.last_name,        p.product_name,         p.price FROM orders o INNER JOIN customers c   ON o.customer_id = c.id INNER JOIN products p   ON o.product_id = p.id WHERE c.last_name = 'Smith'        AND p.price &gt; 100 ORDER BY o.order_date DESC;   It makes the query more readable and easier to understand. When we refer to columns without specifying the table name, it can be difficult to determine which table the column comes from, particularly if the query involves multiple tables.  By including the table name in the SELECT statement we avoid conflicts when joining tables. It is possible for two or more tables to have columns with the same name.   Create temp tables  Temp tables can make the query more readable and easier to understand. Nested queries can become very complex and difficult to read, especially if there are several levels of nesting. It can also improve query performance. When we use a nested query, the database management system has to execute the inner query before it can execute the outer query. This can result in slower query performance, especially if the inner query involves a large amount of data or a complex calculation.  They can be reused in multiple queries. When we use a nested query, we can only use the result set of the inner query once. If we need to use the same result set in multiple queries, we have to execute the inner query multiple times, which can result in slower query performance.   No  SELECT     c.customer_name,     qr.quarter,     COALESCE(qr.quarter_revenue, 0) AS quarter_revenue,     COALESCE(tr.total_revenue, 0) AS total_revenue FROM     customers c     LEFT JOIN (         SELECT             customer_id,             DATE_TRUNC('quarter', order_date) AS quarter,             SUM(price * quantity) AS quarter_revenue         FROM             order_items oi             JOIN orders o ON oi.order_id = o.order_id         GROUP BY             customer_id,             quarter     ) qr ON c.customer_id = qr.customer_id     LEFT JOIN (         SELECT             customer_id,             SUM(price * quantity) AS total_revenue         FROM             order_items oi             JOIN orders o ON oi.order_id = o.order_id         GROUP BY             customer_id     ) tr ON c.customer_id = tr.customer_id;  Yes  -- Create a temp table with all orders and their dates CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE temp_orders AS SELECT     order_id,     customer_id,     order_date,     SUM(price * quantity) AS revenue FROM     order_items GROUP BY     order_id;  -- Create a temp table with the revenue for each quarter of the year CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE temp_quarter_revenue AS SELECT     customer_id,     DATE_TRUNC('quarter', order_date) AS quarter,     SUM(revenue) AS quarter_revenue FROM     temp_orders GROUP BY     customer_id,     quarter;  -- Create a temp table with the total revenue for each customer CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE temp_total_revenue AS SELECT     customer_id,     SUM(revenue) AS total_revenue FROM     temp_orders GROUP BY     customer_id;  -- Combine the temp tables to get the revenue for each quarter and customer SELECT     c.customer_name,     qr.quarter,     COALESCE(qr.quarter_revenue, 0) AS quarter_revenue,     COALESCE(tr.total_revenue, 0) AS total_revenue FROM     customers c     LEFT JOIN temp_quarter_revenue qr ON c.customer_id = qr.customer_id     LEFT JOIN temp_total_revenue tr ON c.customer_id = tr.customer_id;  This query achieves the same result as the previous example, it is more clear and easier to read and understand. It also faster, especially if there are many orders and/or customers, because it is not executing subqueries for each row in the main query. It breaks the query down into smaller, more manageable parts, and simplifies the logic, making it easier to read and optimize.   Use proper naming convention  Overall, it is important to use a consistent naming convention and to choose names that are descriptive, clear, and easy to understand. This makes it easier for users to work with the database and ensures that queries and joins are accurate and efficient.   No  CREATE TABLE emp (     eid INT PRIMARY KEY,     fname VARCHAR(50),     lname VARCHAR(50),     dob DATE,     hdate DATE,     did INT );  Yes  CREATE TABLE employees (     employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,     first_name VARCHAR(50),     last_name VARCHAR(50),     date_of_birth DATE,     hire_date DATE,     department_id INT );  Notice how the table and column names are all abbreviated and use a non-standard naming convention. The table name is in singular form, which could be confusing if there are multiple entities in the table.   The column names use abbreviations, which may not be immediately clear to users who are not familiar with the system. This can make it difficult to understand the relationships between tables and can lead to confusion and errors in querying the database.   Use uppercase keywords  Uppercase is more commonly used for SQL keywords, as it can make the code easier to read and differentiate between keywords and identifiers.  Using uppercase for SQL keywords can help to improve code clarity, as it allows keywords to be easily distinguished from other elements in the query. Additionally, many SQL editors and tools are designed to highlight uppercase keywords, which can further improve readability and make it easier to spot errors.   No  select      count(*) as total_employees,      department  from      employees  where      department in ('Sales', 'Marketing')  group by      department  having      count(*) &gt; 10  order by      total_employees desc;  Yes (Prefer)  SELECT      COUNT(*) AS total_employees,      department  FROM      Employees  WHERE      department IN ('Sales', 'Marketing')  GROUP BY      department  HAVING      COUNT(*) &gt; 10  ORDER BY      total_employees DESC;  Consistency is key when it comes to choosing between uppercase and lowercase keywords. If you‚Äôre working on a team or with a codebase that uses lowercase keywords, it‚Äôs important to maintain that style for the sake of consistency and clarity.  Ultimately, the choice between uppercase and lowercase SQL keywords comes down to personal preference and the style guidelines of your team or organization.   Use proper indentation and white spaces  Using proper indentation and spacing can help to make SQL code more readable and easier to maintain. It‚Äôs important to follow best practices and to keep the code well-organized to prevent errors and improve efficiency.   No  SELECT c.customer_name,o.order_id,p.product_name,od.quantity FROM customers c JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id JOIN order_details od ON o.order_id = od.order_id JOIN products p ON od.product_id = p.product_id WHERE c.city = 'New York' AND o.order_date &gt;= '2022-01-01' AND p.category_id = 2 ORDER BY c.customer_name ASC,o.order_id DESC;  Yes  SELECT      c.customer_name,      o.order_id,      p.product_name,      od.quantity  FROM      customers c      JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id      JOIN order_details od ON o.order_id = od.order_id      JOIN products p ON od.product_id = p.product_id  WHERE      c.city = 'New York'      AND o.order_date &gt;= '2022-01-01'      AND p.category_id = 2  ORDER BY      c.customer_name ASC,      o.order_id DESC;  It‚Äôs a bit faster to read and understand it, isn‚Äôt it?   Summary  SQL optimization can have significant benefits for both performance and team collaboration.  In terms of performance, optimizing SQL queries can significantly reduce the time and resources required to retrieve data from the database.  In terms of team collaboration, SQL optimization can help ensure that the codebase is maintainable and scalable. Optimized SQL queries are generally more readable and easier to understand, which can make it easier for team members to collaborate and work together on projects. Additionally, SQL optimization can help prevent performance issues that may arise due to poorly written queries, which can help reduce the need for constant code maintenance and troubleshooting.  Overall, SQL optimization is crucial for both performance and team collaboration. By optimizing SQL queries, teams can improve the performance of their applications, make their codebase more maintainable, and enhance collaboration and teamwork.  ","categories": [],

        "title": "Fundamentals of Effective Visualization and Communication",
        "excerpt":"Introduction  In data-driven decision-making world, effective visualization and communication of insights play a vital role in driving understanding, engagement, and action. Visualizing data in a clear and compelling manner enables stakeholders to grasp complex information quickly and make informed decisions. In this blog post we explore the fundamentals of an effective visualization and communication approach, along with real-life examples that showcase its impact.    Did you know? 69% of directors have fast-tracked digital business adoption.   Tailor visualizations to the audience  Adapting visualizations to the audience‚Äôs needs and preferences is essential. Consider an ecommerce organization sharing performance metrics with different stakeholders. While executives may prefer high-level summary dashboards with kpis such as sales, orders and revenue, operations team and marketing might benefit from detailed visualizations showcasing operational speed outcomes and CRM campaings effectiveness. By tailoring visualizations to specific user groups, the information becomes more relevant, engaging, and actionable. Three basic pillars of dashboards and visualizations are:          Strategic Dashboards: Provide a high-level overview of key performance indicators (KPIs) aligned with the organization‚Äôs strategic goals. They help executives and senior management track progress, identify trends, and make informed strategic decisions. Strategic dashboards often include summary charts, trend indicators, and visualizations that focus on long-term performance.            Operational Dashboards: Designed to monitor real-time or near-real-time operational data. They provide insights into ongoing processes, performance metrics, and operational efficiency. Operational dashboards are commonly used by managers and operational teams to identify bottlenecks, address issues promptly, and optimize day-to-day operations. These dashboards may include metrics such as sales performance, production rates, or customer service response times etc.            Analytical Dashboards: Used to explore and analyze data in detail. They offer interactive capabilities, allowing users to drill down, filter, and manipulate data to uncover insights. Analytical dashboards are commonly used not only by relevant business stakeholders but additonaly by data professionals to conduct in-depth analysis, identify patterns, and generate hypotheses. These dashboards often include various charts, tables, and filters to support data exploration.          Why? With this report, sales executives can track quarter to date (QTD) sales performance, review numbers in relation to the current quota and previous quarters, filtered by product and opportunity type in this dashboard based on CRM data      Why? Above dashboard analyzes inventory, logistical, and finance data from across the country. Bringing the data into an analytical dashboard allows stakeholders to make sense of big data and empowers analysts to create supply chain and forecasting reports in record time.   Choose the right visualization type  Selecting the appropriate visualization approach is crucial to convey insights effectively. For instance, a retail company analyzing sales performance across different states might use a geographic heat map instead of a simple barchart to highlight sales hotspots and identify areas for expansion. By visually representing sales data on a map, decision-makers can easily identify patterns and make targeted business decisions. In the example below it‚Äôs clear that the company makes the majority of sales in the south. Such kind of information is hidden in our case if we choose a barchart.      Tip This barchart highlights the top states by sales. Don‚Äôt focus on the visualization‚Äôs format (labels etc) but only in its type. The main idea here is that sometimes there are corellations behind data.      Tip In contrast with previous viz, we can now notice that sales are concentrated in the southeast regions. Perhaps this is something that the business may is aware of but imagine a scenario that you found something interesting.Blend your technical skills with analytical thinking and business knowledge.   Choose the right visualization tools  Selecting the right visualization tools can greatly enhance the effectiveness of data communication. From widely used tools like Tableau and Power BI to programming languages like Python with libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn, the choice depends on factors like data complexity, interactivity requirements, and the target audience‚Äôs familiarity with the tools. Understand the Data: Begin by thoroughly understanding the nature of your data. Consider its complexity, size, structure, and the relationships you want to highlight. Determine whether the data is numerical, categorical, time-series, spatial, or a combination of these.   Define Objectives and Audience: Clarify your objectives for data visualization. Are you aiming to explore patterns, present trends, compare data, or tell a compelling story? Additionally, identify your target audience and their familiarity with visualization tools. This information will guide you in selecting user-friendly options or more advanced tools.   Assess Data Interactivity Requirements: Evaluate whether your visualization needs to be interactive. Interactive visualizations allow users to explore and manipulate data, providing a more engaging experience. Consider if you require features like filtering, drill-down, zooming, or hover-over tooltips to enhance data exploration.   Consider Data Size and Performance: If you are dealing with large datasets, assess the performance capabilities of the visualization tools. Some tools may struggle to handle extensive data, resulting in slow rendering or potential crashes. Ensure the chosen tool can efficiently handle the volume of data you‚Äôre working with.   Evaluate Tool Capabilities: Research and compare the features and capabilities of different visualization tools.
